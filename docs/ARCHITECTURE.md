# Architecture

## Overview

GoatStare is a desktop control plane for running user-owned WireGuard VPN infrastructure through provider adapters and a unified NodeProvider interface.

Stack:

- Next.js + React frontend for operator workflows
- Tauri command bridge for typed frontend/backend calls
- Rust backend for orchestration, provider adapters, lifecycle state, and diagnostics
- SQLite for local metadata and runtime snapshots
- Windows Credential Manager for secret storage
- WireGuard for Windows on the machine running the app; tunnels are managed through its service.

Included provider adapters:

- DigitalOcean adapter for cloud VPS lifecycle
- Docker adapter for local container-backed development workflows

## Core Responsibilities

- Frontend: user workflows for provider, node, tunnel, health, and diagnostics.
- Command layer: typed boundary and error mapping.
- Orchestrator: lifecycle transitions, idempotency, reconciliation, cleanup.
- Provider registry: adapter resolution by provider slug and NodeProvider construction.
- NodeProvider: provider-neutral lifecycle contract for init, bootstrap readiness, status, existence checks, and delete.
- Provider adapters: low-level provider implementation details for validate, catalog, create, wait, and delete.
- WireGuard manager: generate keys, and import, activate, deactivate, and unregister tunnels through the WireGuard for Windows service.
- Key management: generate and store key material on the app host; never generate client keys on remote nodes.

## Connection Model

- There is one connection path: the WireGuard for Windows tunnel service.
- Elevation is requested for connect and disconnect only, and only after a direct attempt is refused for permissions. Status reads never elevate.
- An earlier `Admin Mode` / `User Mode` toggle was removed. It promised a second, in-process adapter runtime that could not work — the adapter was destroyed when its creating function returned, and interface reads always failed for want of an adapter handle — so Admin Mode silently fell back to the service path and the two modes were identical in practice.

## Global App Settings

Desktop-wide runtime settings are persisted in SQLite through a dedicated `app_settings` table owned by the Rust backend.

Rules:

- The backend is the source of truth for global runtime settings used during tunnel lifecycle operations.
- The frontend reads and updates these settings only through typed Tauri commands.
- Settings must be additive, versioned through migrations, and safe for existing installs.
- Secret values must not be stored in app settings.

The table currently holds no settings. It previously held `wireguard_connection_mode`, removed in
migration 0014 along with the connection-mode toggle (see Connection Model above). The table is
kept because the migration path and access pattern are useful for future settings.

## Unified NodeProvider Contract

The orchestrator and command layer operate against a shared NodeProvider abstraction instead of reaching directly into provider-specific execution paths.

The contract covers:

- `init`: provision a node, persist the bootstrapping context, and return a bootstrap contract preview.
- `wait_for_bootstrap_ready`: wait for provider-specific readiness markers and resolve the bootstrap output contract.
- `get_status`: report the provider-level node status in a normalized form.
- `exists`: check whether the node still exists.
- `delete`: tear down the provider-side node resource.

The registry resolves the correct provider adapter, loads the provider token from secure storage, and presents that provider through the shared NodeProvider interface to the orchestrator.

## Lifecycle Model

### Node states

- `new`
- `provisioning`
- `bootstrapping`
- `ready`
- `connected`
- `error`
- `deleting`

### Tunnel states

- `new`
- `ready`
- `connected`
- `disconnected`
- `error`
- `deleting`

State changes are validated in backend transition guards.

## Trust Boundaries

- Frontend input boundary: all command inputs are treated as untrusted.
- Secret boundary: secure storage keeps secret values out of SQLite.
- Provider boundary: remote API responses are validated and normalized.
- Local runtime boundary: `wireguard.exe`, `sc`, `wg`, and Docker command output are treated as untrusted process output.

## Data Flow

1. Register and validate provider credentials.
2. Fetch region and pricing catalog.
3. Verify WireGuard for Windows is installed on the app host.
4. Generate WireGuard keypair on the app host (where the app resides) and persist secrets locally.
5. Provision node with an init script that receives and applies the generated public key.
6. Wait for bootstrap readiness and verify node-side WireGuard configuration.
7. Configure and activate the client tunnel locally through the WireGuard tunnel service.
8. Poll health and diagnostics.
9. Disconnect, destroy, or force-cleanup as required.

## Key Generation And Bootstrap Requirements

- Key generation location: WireGuard key generation must happen on the same machine where the app runs.
- Host dependency: the app host must have WireGuard for Windows installed. No driver DLL is bundled or downloaded.
- Private key handling: private key material remains local to the app host and secure storage boundary.
- Public key propagation: the generated public key is injected into the provider/node init script payload.
- Node bootstrap contract: init script must set the public key in node WireGuard config during first boot.
- Verification: bootstrap readiness must include confirmation that the node has applied the expected public key.

## Reliability Patterns

- Idempotent cleanup semantics for partial failures.
- Startup reconciliation for stale local/remote state.
- Explicit recovery flows in the UI for provider and local WireGuard runtime failures.
